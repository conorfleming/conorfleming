abstract = "Several commercial tidal turbine designs feature axial flow rotors within bi-directional ducts, which are typically intended to increase power extraction through a flow-concentrating effect. This study investigates the relative performance of these turbines in confined flow. Several duct profiles are evaluated using the Reynolds-averaged Navierâ€“Stokes solver ANSYS Fluent, with the rotor represented as an actuator disc. The fundamental effect of a duct on a rotor, as well as the secondary effects of duct camber and thickness, are identified. Ducts are found to limit the expansion of the downstream flow, in turn restricting the pressure reduction immediately behind the rotor. This effect, in combination with a reduction in flow, results in reduced power extraction. Where a ducted rotor is desirable for other reasons, e.g. for the protection of rotor blades, a thick profile with slight curvature performs best."
