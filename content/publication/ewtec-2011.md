abstract = "A duct for a tidal turbine is designed through simulation and analysis of a series of candidate geometries in which internal and external curvature are varied. Duct performance is evaluated in terms of power extraction and basin-scale efficiency, where the rotor is modelled as an actuator disk. The effects of surface curvature are identified: a flat external surface limits the size of the separated recirculating flow downstream of the leading edge of the duct thereby reducing losses, and increased curvature of the duct inner surface leads to increased flow velocity, but at the expense of rotor area. A degree of internal curvature is found which achieves the best balance between flow acceleration and power-extracting area. The best bi-directional ducted device only achieves a maximum power of 57% of the equivalent diameter unducted device."
