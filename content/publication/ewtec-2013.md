abstract = "The effect of flow shear on turbine performance and wake development is examined. A computational model of an axial flow tidal turbine is developed and validated, and performance is evaluated in sheared velocity profiles representative of a tidal channel. Rotor thrust and power are observed to increase with elevation above the channel bed. This is a consequence of the higher kinetic flux in upper portion of the velocity profile. Further, it is found that using an alternative normalisation for thrust and power, based on the upstream velocity profile in place of a single reference velocity, enables collapse of results across a range of sheared profiles."
