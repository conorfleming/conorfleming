abstract = "A three dimensional computational model of a full scale axial flow tidal turbine has been used to investigate the effects of a range of realistic environmental conditions on turbine performance. A parametric study has been carried out to investigate the effects of flow shear, confinement and alignment on turbine performance, structural loading, and wake recovery."
