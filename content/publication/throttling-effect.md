abstract = "This paper is concerned with the throttling effect of a tunnel fire and how it is treated in one-dimensional flow solvers. We explain the primary mechanisms by which airflow is resisted by a tunnel fire. While compressible flow solvers inherently capture these mechanisms, corrections are required for incompressible solvers. In one approach, where a user-controlled parameter is required, we suggest a method for its reliable calculation."
