abstract = "This presentation considers the different perspectives of the designer and operator of a road tunnel. Typically, the designer considers worst-case design conditions. While the incidents which the operator encounters may objectively be less onerous (e.g. lower fire heat release rate) the conditions may be substantially different to expectations, e.g. changing wind direction, and the default operational response may not be appropriate. Hence the operational safety of tunnels could benefit from improved collaboration of designers and operators of tunnel ventilation systems - for example operator involvement at the design stage and vice versa."
